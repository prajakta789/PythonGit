       "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas\\r\\nfrom _io import StringIO\\r\\n\\r\\ntable = '<table><tr><td> </td></tr></table>'\\r\\nres = pandas.read_html(StringIO(table), flavor='lxml')\\r\\nprint(len(res))\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nFrom the `read_html` docstring: \\r\\n\\r\\n> This function will *always* return a list of :class:`DataFrame` *or*\\r\\n    it will fail, i.e., it will *not* return an empty list.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has something to do with the space in the `<td>` tag in the example. Removing the space causes the function to fail instead.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThe function should either fail, or return a list containing a `DataFrame` representing a 1x1 table (either empty or containing the space character in its only cell). Don't know which is more appropriate. \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.9.19.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 5.10.0-30-amd64\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Debian 5.10.218-1 (2024-06-01)\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : \\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.24.1\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.5.1\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.2.2\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\r\\nIPython               : None\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.5.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.4\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.13.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.30\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': '- [ x ] closes [#54328](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54328) (partially)\\r\\n- [ x ] [Tests added and passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#writing-tests) if fixing a bug or adding a new feature\\r\\n- [ x ] All [code checks passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#pre-commit).\\r\\n- [ x  ] Added [type annotations](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#type-hints) to new arguments/methods/functions.\\r\\n- [ x ] Added an entry in the latest `doc/source/whatsnew/v3.0.0.rst` \\r\\n\\r\\nThis change enables EWMA to be calculated recursively (\"infinite history\", i.e. `adjust=False`) for irregular-interval time series. Previously `new_wt` was held constant in the ewm run loop, but now `new_wt` is updated each step through the series under the narrow condition that `adjust=False` and `com=1`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere may be a more elegant expression that will generalize to `com` values different than one, but using `1 - old_wt` works nicely if `halflife` is the only provided decay parameter since we are guaranteed `com=1`. The additional parameter restrictions to force this condition seem acceptable since there is already [some restriction](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.ewm.html) on decay parameters.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Exactly one of `com`, `span`, `halflife`, or `alpha` must be provided if `times` is not provided. If `times` is provided, `halflife` and one of `com`, `span` or `alpha` may be provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nFWIW I confirmed that results match polars and @azmyrajab\\'s nice [test function](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54328#issuecomment-2072214710):\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nema_no_adjust = ema_test(vals, dt_seconds, half_life=half_life_seconds)[-1]\\r\\nema_no_adjust_pl = ema_polars(df[\"val\"].rename_axis(index=\"ts\").rename(\"val\"), half_life,\\r\\n                              by=\"ts\").select(\"val\")[-1].item()\\r\\n\\r\\nprint(ema_no_adjust)\\r\\nprint(ema_no_adjust_pl)\\r\\nprint(df.ewm(halflife=half_life, times=id, adjust=False).mean().iloc[-1][\\'val\\'])\\r\\n\\r\\n0.2062994740159002\\r\\n0.2062994740159002\\r\\n0.2062994740159002\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

There are some rows with missing data, but in this dataset, they denote that by using a very large negative number. My plan was to use the query function to filter the rows to only those that have values greater than or equal to zero in every numeric column. \\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nI wish the query function would let me do something like this df.query('* >= 0') the star * representing all columns. Better yet, would be if I could use star but subtract the columns to be excluded from that like df.query('* -state -county >= 0').\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nWhat I am going to do is loop through the columns of the data frame and query on each one using a variable and exclude those non-numeric from my list. Like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```column_list = df.columns\\r\\ncolumn_list.remove('state')\\r\\ncolumn_list.remove('county')\\r\\n\\r\\nfor column in column_list:\\r\\n    df = df.query('@column >= 0')\\r\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_\",\n",

Coming from the historical NumPy perspective, the implementation uses twice as much memory. Compared to PyArrow the memory usage is 8x as much and computational algorithms can be up to 64x slower\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nThe pd.arrays.BooleanArray could use nanoarrow behind the scenes for its implementation, rather than the existing NumPy approach. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the main technical challenges for this would be:\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Build system integration. nanoarrow is already available in the Meson WrapDB and progress is underway with [nanobind](https://github.com/mesonbuild/wrapdb/pull/1556); probably worth waiting for the latter, but once complete this is less of a concern\\r\\n  2. 2D support, if ever needed. You could try to simulate 2D indexing operations with a bitmask, but something like transposition (which are trivial with a bytemask) is a concept that does not translate well moving from bytes to bits . I don't know that this is a huge issue since the existing BooleanArray does not support 2D, but @jbrockmendel probably knows best on any plans for that\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nstatus quo\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_\",\n",
